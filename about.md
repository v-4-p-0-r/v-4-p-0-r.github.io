G r e e t i n g s  t r a v e l e r

My handle is v4p0r, I am a computer science student, who is studying security in my free time. I am primarily working with binary hacking currently, but I plan to soon branch out and focus on other types of exploits and security too.

My goal with this site is to adequately document challenges I complete, focusing on documenting my thought process and explaining underlying concepts. Hopefully the posts here will prove useful in helping others learn security as well.
